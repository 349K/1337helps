Usage: xzdiff [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2]
Compare FILE1 to FILE2, using their uncompressed contents if they are
compressed.  If FILE2 is omitted, then the files compared are FILE1 and
FILE1 from which the compression format suffix has been stripped.

Do comparisons like 'diff' does.  OPTIONs are the same as for 'diff'.
