Usage:
    podchecker [-help] [-man] [-(no)warnings] [*file* ...]

Options and Arguments:
    -help   Print a brief help message and exit.

    -man    Print the manual page and exit.

    -warnings -nowarnings
            Turn on/off printing of warnings. Repeating -warnings increases
            the warning level, i.e. more warnings are printed. Currently
            increasing to level two causes flagging of unescaped "<,>"
            characters.

    *file*  The pathname of a POD file to syntax-check (defaults to standard
            input).
